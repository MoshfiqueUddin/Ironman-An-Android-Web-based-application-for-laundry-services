# Ironman-An-Android-Web-based-application-for-laundry-services
This is from my final year capstone project. I have a publication in IEEE xplore about this project. This project is about an Ai based laundry application and website.
The majority of people despise the chore of ironing clothes but enjoy wearing nice, crisp, 
wrinkle-free clothes. IronMan provides steam ironing services right to your door. IronMan is a 
service that supplies ironing and laundry services online. In our work, we hoped to create an 
innovative Internet of Things (IoT)-based Laundry Services E-commerce business model. This 
work will bring laundry service right to your door, in the palm of your hand. This work will 
include a proper Android app for accessing nearby laundry shop services from home, as well as a 
related website to this android app. In this application, a machine learning model was used to 
create intelligent logistic management systems. Using this application, people can easily access 
laundry services while staying at home. Nowadays people are more inclined to market from 
online shops rather than going outside. Our project "IronMan: An Android-Web Based 
Application for Laundry Services" follows the same pattern for laundry service providers and 
consumers. In most of the laundry shops, they do not really keep records of their customers. So 
there is a possibility that the clothes of the customers may mix up with one another. This system 
helps users to not only track their order but also physically scan their items using image 
classification into their list with an image proof to avoid any mismatch and help customer claim 
if mix-up happens. Our work has location tracker for riders to accept the nearest order so that the 
customer gets a smooth experience. We also have our website for users to create their account 
and check their services display and customer can order from both web and phone
